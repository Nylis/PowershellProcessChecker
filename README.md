There once was a man named Gold Roger who was king of the pirates! He had fame, power, and wealth beyond your wildest dreams! Before they hung him from the gallows, these were the final words he said: "My fortune is yours for the taking, but you’ll have to find it first. I left everything I own in One Piece." Ever since, pirates from all over the world set sail for the Grand Line, searching for One Piece, the treasure that would make their dreams come true! YO! Gotta go, gotta go! Dreamin’! Don’t give it up Luffy! Dreamin’! Don’t give it up Zolo! Dreamin’! Don’t give it up Nami! Dreamin’! Don’t give it, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it— NOW! Here’s how the story goes: we find out 'bout a treasure in the Grand Line, there’s no doubt! The pirate whose eye is on it, he’ll sing: "I’ll be King of the Pirates, I’m gonna be King!" Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, oh-ho! His name is Luffy, that’s Monkey D. Luffy! Gonna be King of the Pirates! He’s made of rubber! How did that happen? Yo-ho-ho, he took a bite of Gum-Gum! Gotta go, gotta go! His name’s Zolo, he’s just like a samurai, and an L-A-D-Y, Nami’s not shy. Usopp’s doing that marksman thing, Sanji’s cookin', Chopper’s doctoring! Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go, oh-ho! Set sail for One Piece, it’s the name of the treasure in the Grand Line! Gotta go, gotta go, set sail for One Piece!
